## Description
- The purpose of this project is to create a README generator
- The generator uses user answers to questions to automatically create a markdown document
- The application has two modes - Basic and Advanced
- The application is written in JavaScript and intended for execution via Node.Js


## Installation Instructions
- The application requires the colors and inquirer packages to be installed in the project folder
- The packages can be installed via the " npm install colors inquirer" command 
- Addtionally, the native fs package as well as custom packages (for functions and data) are used
- The imports are handled as modules (the package.json file has to be updated to contain the "type":"module" expression)


## How to Use the App
- To create a README.md for simple code with little description needed, use the Basic mode
- To create a README.md for complex code, use the Advanced mode
- The advanced mode allows to provide more bullet points for each section
- It also allows the user to delete entries (in case they make a mistake) or replace existing entries
- The advanced mode also tracks progress along the way so that the user knows where they are at in the process
